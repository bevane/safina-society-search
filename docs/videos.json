from prophethood all the way to us and that chain consists of scholars\n\n3\n00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,640\n so the most trials does not mean the most stressed he has the greatest of trials so\n\n4\n00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960\n how do we put this two together how does this make any sense how are you the greatest of trials\n\n5\n00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,840\n and the least of stress the intensity of the du'at is what brings down forgiveness people\n\n6\n00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560\n make du'at and their du'at is never answered it's because they're flinging trying to fling an arrow\n\n7\n00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,400\n in the sky and they're not pulling the thread hard enough the asbab have no role whatsoever\n\n8\n00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,680\n in transforming you in bringing in an effect zero but it's necessary\n\n9\n00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,560\n bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem alhamdulillah wassalatu wassalamu ala rasulillah\n\n10\n00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,600\n ala ala alihi wa sahbihi wa man wala allahumma salli wassalam ala sayyidina muhammad al-fatiha\n\n11\n00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,160\n lima ughliq wal khatimi lima sabak nasir al-haqq bilhaq wal haadi ila siratika al-mustaqeem\n\n12\n00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,760\n sallallahu alaihi wa ala alihi wa sahbihi haqqa qadrihim iqdarihi al-adhim\n\n13\n00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,960\n amma ba'at uh the title of trials of prophethood is extremely important\n\n14\n00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,560\n anbiya the way they get tested and the way they react to those tests basically is an education for\n\n15\n00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,720\n us now a lot of people they know the famous hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wassalam said\n\n16\n00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,680\n ashaddu al nasi bala'an al-anbiya thumma al-ladhina yulunahum thumma yal-ladhina yulunahum\n\n17\n00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,800\n the the the most tested of all people the most bala that pours down on people\n\n18\n00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:48,160\n uh is the prophets more than anybody else then those after them in piety in knowledge and iman\n\n19\n00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,360\n and then those after them and piety should never be separated from knowledge\n\n20\n00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:02,160\n the vast majority of the most pious are also the most knowledgeable\n\n21\n00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:12,960\n this is why allah says basically allah says when the when the pious are presented before them\n\n22\n00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,040\n before him essentially he's saying they're all scholars essentially they're all scholars\n\n23\n00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:26,800\n this is like limited very rarely you will see somebody who has reached the level of khashya\n\n24\n00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800\n without first attaining the level of knowledge so you got to learn you have to become educated\n\n25\n00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,000\n now how do you become educated nobody self-educates in any field in life\n\n26\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,440\n there's no electrician who just puts up the lights and nobody knows his name nobody cares about him\n\n27\n00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,800\n nobody you pay him and you never see him again he just put up your lights he they have to actually\n\n28\n00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,600\n become basically disciples of another electrician for five years\n\n29\n00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,040\n we don't even care about them name an electrician because it's so important\n\n30\n00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,160\n now the people who sit up here and talk to you about your akhira\n\n31\n00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,160\n they're built infinitely more important\n\n32\n00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,680\n than merely an electrician so you cannot be somebody who gains knowledge without first\n\n33\n00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,680\n being mentored being taught sitting at the feet of those who learned and being submissive to them\n\n34\n00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,960\n submissive is the word you have to believe in them first you got to ask yourself is this person\n\n35\n00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,880\n person worthy of following do i believe that they understand the quran and the sunnah better than me\n\n36\n00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,800\n do they understand it properly have others vouched for him them that they understand it properly\n\n37\n00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,680\n that's how you know somebody is worthy of following well sheikh so-and-so and sheikh so-and-so and they're\n\n38\n00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,200\n all vouched for him how do they vouch for him well we see them at meetings together they invite each other they\n\n39\n00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:11,280\n are always together that is a vouching not an accidental meeting no regularly they're always together at events\n\n40\n00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,800\n they're always referring to each other that's them vouching for one another that's where you start\n\n41\n00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,760\n to trust secondly you do have knowledge not everything in islam needs to be studied\n\n42\n00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:29,680\n there's in baruri you don't need to study does anyone need to study that we follow the prophet does\n\n43\n00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,680\n anyone need to study that we fast ramadan does anyone need to study that the quran is preserved all these\n\n44\n00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,240\n things there's daruri knowledge based upon that you can make your assessment so you're not a complete\n\n45\n00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,360\n bare slate once you take on somebody like that now you're treading the path of prophethood\n\n46\n00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,960\n because that person had to sit at the feet of somebody who had to sit at the feet of somebody\n\n47\n00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,480\n so when we're talking about the trials of prophets we eventually have to talk about the chain of\n\n48\n00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,080\n transmission from prophethood all the way to us and that chain consists of scholars we should never\n\n49\n00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960\n separate between the pious and between the scholars because allah never separated him in the ayah of khashya\n\n50\n00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,800\n let me tell you a story about one of the greats abdul wahhab shahrani of egypt he was a maliki scholar in\n\n51\n00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800\n kaira at azhar university at al azhar jama al azhar\n\n52\n00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:41,440\n there was around one of the walls of the mosque off on the street like in the sidewalk almost\n\n53\n00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:51,200\n there was a sheikh who was not a scholar but he was very learned in another way in the path of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\n\n54\n00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,600\n but he didn't have knowledge of fatwa he couldn't give fatwa in fiqh he was very\n\n55\n00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,200\n simple in fiqh but in knowledge of allah which you couldn't tell he was a great scholar but he used\n\n56\n00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,120\n to live with the simple people and teach them prayers and they used to recite their prayers\n\n57\n00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,160\n every day abdul wahhab shahrani would shake his head in disapproval thinking imagining the only knowledge\n\n58\n00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,200\n knowledge is the law that's not the only knowledge it's very important knowledge\n\n59\n00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,320\n and he used to say to him\n\n60\n00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,120\n Allah has not taken a wali who's ignorant like you don't know fiqh\n\n61\n00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,560\n so he kept saying this and he kept saying this and he kept saying this and he kept saying this\n\n62\n00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,840\n until allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\n\n63\n00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:51,920\n something ajeeb happened that day the night before abdul wahhab shahrani he was married to a young\n\n64\n00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,000\n girl she was silly he was a young scholar and he had a young wife she was like a silly girl sometimes\n\n65\n00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:07,280\n not every woman is serious some women are silly okay testimony to upright witnesses\n\n66\n00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:18,480\n and i have two daughters one is very serious one is very silly so i can say this so his wife was silly\n\n67\n00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,440\n and he wants and he had a baby and he was taking his baby around the house like a horse playing horsey\n\n68\n00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:34,720\n with his baby on all fours okay then she said hey it's my turn and she rides on him and he rode around with his wife\n\n69\n00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,560\n right this happened in the privacy of their own home\n\n70\n00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,840\n well next day he goes and he looks down at this man\n\n71\n00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,440\n and he says matakhad allahum a wali in jahad allah does not take an ignorant man as a wali okay\n\n72\n00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,520\n and he looks up to him and he says shut your mouth you donkey of zaynab\n\n73\n00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:07,360\n how did he know that okay because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said 146th of prophecy\n\n74\n00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,200\n remains amongst you and that is the true dream so allah ta'ala can show you\n\n75\n00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,440\n the affairs of the you have a man humiliating you every single day and saying allah doesn't take\n\n76\n00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,040\n a wali who's ignorant allah doesn't take a wali who's ignorant okay you're going to embarrass him\n\n77\n00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,840\n how do you know allah doesn't have his back and allah therefore exposed you\n\n78\n00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,240\n nobody knew this nobody knows his wife's name\n\n79\n00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:44,960\n abdul wahab is sharani then he stops and he sits down and then he becomes his student and he understands\n\n80\n00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:52,080\n that the knowledge is the knowledge of the outward law and the inward path to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\n\n81\n00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,160\n so if we're talking about the trials of prophethood the premise here is to be on the path of prophethood\n\n82\n00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,720\n that is the path of prophethood is a path of knowledge and ibadah now people talk about the\n\n83\n00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,120\n the trials of this hadith and they get afraid they said oh maybe i don't want to have so much taqwa\n\n84\n00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,360\n i don't want to go this path because i don't want to be tested i'm afraid to be tested\n\n85\n00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,920\n right this thought comes upon people's minds now you have to complete the matter because that one\n\n86\n00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,120\n hadith is a partial truth it's not the full truth the full truth comes in other hadith like what\n\n87\n00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,520\n the prophet was described as the happiest of people and the least in white hairs\n\n88\n00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:50,320\n and the flattest of stomachs so how is the prophet maintaining this health\n\n89\n00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,000\n maintaining this happiness at 63 he didn't have wrinkles on his face and he didn't have any white\n\n90\n00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,280\n hairs so therefore his stress is low why do people gain a lot of weight at certain points in life\n\n91\n00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,960\n they stress eat they come home at night there's so much on their mind they're really not that happy\n\n92\n00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,280\n the only thing that maybe make them happy is some food right this is called stress eating\n\n93\n00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,480\n people do this all the time you don't do this when you're young because you don't have stress\n\n94\n00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,600\n i laugh when a young person says i'm stressed what's i mean if you got normal circumstances you\n\n95\n00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,960\n haven't seen you don't know what's coming if you think you're stressed at wait you lost your parents\n\n96\n00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:42,480\n no my parents are alive okay you lost your leg no i got all my limbs i got my eyes what are you\n\n97\n00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,920\n stressed about you don't pay your mortgage your parents your dad pays it what are you stressed about\n\n98\n00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,520\n right anyway you'll see when you grow up there are things that are stressors in life and people\n\n99\n00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,800\n stress eat and they start turning white and they start getting\n\n100\n00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,840\n why do wrinkles happen oftentimes because your face is contorted with stress\n\n101\n00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,280\n so the prophet has none of the attributes of someone who's stressed\n\n102\n00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,320\n and he's described as the happiest of people\n\n103\n00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,200\n so the most trials does not mean the most stressed he has the greatest of trials\n\n104\n00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,560\n so how do we put this two together how does this make any sense how are you the greatest of trials\n\n105\n00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,880\n and the least of stress how can you be in the worst hurricane and be the driest person\n\n106\n00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,440\n simple answer you got a strong roof that's what we have to talk about when we talk about the\n\n107\n00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,640\n understanding of the trials of prophethood they have the worst trials\n\n108\n00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:56,720\n the worst rain they're the driest people it's because they have the strongest roof\n\n109\n00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,840\n the ultimate number one pillar now this roof is contains pillars and beams\n\n110\n00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,840\n the number one pillar that everyone has to keep in mind with every trial and tribulation is the saying of\n\n111\n00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,720\n seyyidna musa inhiya illa fitnatuka tudillu biha man tashaa watahdi biha man tashaa many people worry about this ayah\n\n112\n00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,800\n it says that the bani israel we know that they worshiped the golden calf\n\n113\n00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,400\n then they got punished for that then they had to go make repentance then they went up to the mountain\n\n114\n00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,320\n at the mountain they're supposed to repent the leaders 70 leaders we're supposed to spend the whole day with musa\n\n115\n00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,120\n a couple days worshiping a lot repenting\n\n116\n00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,600\n for what they had done worshiping the golden calf okay\n\n117\n00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,360\n while they're there sayyidna musa advanced a little bit up mount sinai\n\n118\n00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,600\n as he begins his ibadah and his recitation a cloud descends upon him and they watch\n\n119\n00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,520\n they're reciting and they're watching and they hear his voice they're following they're reciting the\n\n120\n00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,000\n torah with him all of a sudden they see these lights these beautiful lights flashing back and forth back and\n\n121\n00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:24,240\n forth and they took a break in the middle of this while he's reciting and this beautiful lights\n\n122\n00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,280\n one of them shouts out in the middle of the recitation\n\n123\n00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:35,280\n let us see allah himself now we just had a brother reciting here like abdul basit\n\n124\n00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,680\n imagine if someone shouts out in the middle of the recitation you break the mood\n\n125\n00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,280\n that's this here in texas not mount sinai\n\n126\n00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:53,280\n not with a prophet they why you break his recitation and you ask an absurd question\n\n127\n00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,560\n an absurd question let us see allah you're lucky you are alive you're seeking forgiveness why are you\n\n128\n00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:10,160\n asking questions do you just worship the golden calf now you're coming to seek forgiveness and you're asking\n\n129\n00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,520\n for a maqam a level even your prophet never asked for that\n\n130\n00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:21,600\n then sayyidna musa alayhi salam he said oh allah they're saying they want to see you\n\n131\n00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:30,320\n okay they then he then said to them then let them look up as soon as they looked\n\n132\n00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:39,120\n a tajalli came down they couldn't handle it they dropped dead 70 people 70 liters drop dead\n\n133\n00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:48,560\n now prophet musa he is not on great terms with his people you have to understand this well nobody\n\n134\n00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:57,200\n is he's not on good terms with those people they just he just had to have an execution amongst them\n\n135\n00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,280\n many of them were executed okay you know you know the story of their execution\n\n136\n00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,280\n they all worshiped the golden calf except for very few people what is the punishment of apostasy\n\n137\n00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,640\n execution that was the law given to musa\n\n138\n00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:24,960\n so when he came down and a bunch of them worshiped the golden calf some were hanging out next to it some\n\n139\n00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,480\n we're not worshiping it it's a mixed group how do we rule and how do we execute our own people like\n\n140\n00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:41,600\n son executes father that's cruel uh i execute a guy and then his son is my friend it's not going to work\n\n141\n00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:52,320\n sayna jibrid comes down oh musa wake everybody up in the last portion of the night when it's pitch black\n\n142\n00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:03,360\n both sides are to be given daggers you stand up on a hill and you announce to them\n\n143\n00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:12,000\n to go and attack one another meanwhile you keep your hands raised up like this not\n\n144\n00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,280\n like this up like this\n\n145\n00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:23,680\n begging allah ta'ala for his mercy and his forgiveness in this way they're going to all injure each other\n\n146\n00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,560\n but nobody's going to know who injured who it's going to be done in the dark next morning no one\n\n147\n00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,400\n knows who injured who that's your punishment some will die some will be injured what happens\n\n148\n00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,600\n whatever happens happens everyone because some of you were there and you didn't stop it you're guilty\n\n149\n00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,960\n yeah if i see someone come and bring a buddha right here and we all sit here and continue giving\n\n150\n00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,000\n the talk who's guilty every single one of us us the guy who brought the buddha or all of us\n\n151\n00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,880\n all of us right someone comes here and starts beating a child and we sit here continue giving\n\n152\n00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,800\n the talk who's guilty all of us are guilty so they're all guilty and they come and the wisdom\n\n153\n00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,600\n that keep prophet musa keeps has to keep his hands up because hands are going to get tired\n\n154\n00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,360\n the more tired his hands gets the more intense his dua will be and that will bring down the forgiveness\n\n155\n00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,840\n the intensity of the dua is what brings down forgiveness people make dua and their dua\n\n156\n00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:33,280\n is never answered it's because they're flinging trying to fling an arrow in the sky and they're not\n\n157\n00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,640\n pulling the thread hard enough if you made a lot of dua and your dua never gets answered okay you're\n\n158\n00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,720\n not pulling it hard enough your dua is coming up like this it's a it's a weak dua\n\n159\n00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,280\n the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if you want your dua answered ask with desperation desperation\n\n160\n00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:04,800\n okay and they use the example of the child there are some kids they get so emotionally attached to\n\n161\n00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,600\n something okay when they ask for it they don't stop and they ask with great intensity that the parent has to\n\n162\n00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,640\n give in to it and there are other children who are afraid to talk to their parents usually the first\n\n163\n00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:28,080\n child he's timid he's afraid to ask okay so he doesn't get anything then you have usually the last\n\n164\n00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:35,600\n child he's very emotional about asking about getting something he gets it and the first child says grows up\n\n165\n00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,040\n and says he got everything i did it he asked that's the difference what is the difference between some\n\n166\n00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:49,680\n people live a great life of deen and dunya and marriage and children and wealth and health and other\n\n167\n00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,920\n people don't there's probably only one reason one asked and the other didn't one believed allah's generous\n\n168\n00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:03,040\n ask ask intent with intention ask with intensity with desperation you receive the other one didn't ask so\n\n169\n00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,280\n he's not going to receive anything that's how simple it is that's how simple it is so sayyidna musa\n\n170\n00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,120\n intensely asked and then the punishment stopped and then everyone went home limped home injured some dead\n\n171\n00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,400\n some alive some who knows what happened to them so they were already in pain and suffering because of\n\n172\n00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,320\n what happened you want to see a tribulation this is the this is the origin now the history of why prophet\n\n173\n00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,480\n musa said in here illa fitnatuka tudullu biya man sha'u tati biya man sha'u so now after this\n\n174\n00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:45,280\n allah tells sayyidna musa you have to take 70 members of your tribe of the leaders 70 leaders of the\n\n175\n00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:55,120\n tribe that means about five leaders per tribe there's 12 tribes of israel so you take 70 so about five\n\n176\n00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:03,200\n four to six from each tribe of the elders and they have to go with you up to the mountain and\n\n177\n00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120\n they have to worship of allah for some period of time their hearts will become pure their hearts will\n\n178\n00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,960\n become clean their hearts will become filled with light they go back to their people and they spread\n\n179\n00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,920\n that that's the idea then allah loves them again okay because the love of allah ta'ala is not\n\n180\n00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,280\n something that's guaranteed unlike christianity we don't say god loves everybody clearly the quran\n\n181\n00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,960\n does not say that there are seven categories in which allah says he loves and seven categories he says\n\n182\n00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,800\n he does not love if you do the love of allah ta'ala is something you can turn on and off\n\n183\n00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,560\n okay you have to earn it what we say is god has mercy with everybody a murderer\n\n184\n00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,800\n while he's murdering is he not breathing is he not enjoying the sun is he not eating food is he not\n\n185\n00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,360\n sleeping that's mercy right so that's the mercy that allah has for everybody does not love everybody\n\n186\n00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,160\n anybody that says to me god loves everybody why are you muslims always blaming somebody god loves\n\n187\n00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:09,120\n everybody immediately i say so he loves hitler okay so he loves jesus mary and hitler make it make sense\n\n188\n00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,360\n so what's going on here then they have to they have to keep quiet because hitler essentially has\n\n189\n00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:23,600\n replaced in western civilization satan satan is now some kind of they sort of like him and hitler is the\n\n190\n00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,000\n shaitan he is iblis he has replaced iblis okay so you just replace anything that they say\n\n191\n00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800\n and you apply it to hitler and see if it works or not\n\n192\n00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:43,200\n so they go up to the mountain and that is where while sayidna musa is reciting they all said show us\n\n193\n00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,520\n allah himself or else we won't believe what after all this show us allah or else we won't believe\n\n194\n00:21:51,520 --> 00:22:00,640\n so allah ta'ala had a tajalli what is a tajalli tajalli is that the divine can manifest in a\n\n195\n00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,880\n make a manifestation of his power through a creation or his will you have to understand\n\n196\n00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,440\n what a tajalli is it is not the manifestation of god's essence through a creation that can never\n\n197\n00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,080\n happen the essence of allah never enters into the creation that is an impossibility\n\n198\n00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,880\n unlike the christian belief where the essence of god enters jesus a tajalli is the will of allah\n\n199\n00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:38,240\n manifest through a created thing okay tajalli that is a tajalli and in fact in some sense everything is\n\n200\n00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,640\n a tajalli everything is a manifestation of god's different wills of allah's different wills but\n\n201\n00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,680\n some tajallis are greater than others some are just normal they happen every day okay but some are\n\n202\n00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,240\n unique and so a bright light came down they looked at it they all died\n\n203\n00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,040\n now sayyid namusa alayhi salam was in a massive calamity this was supposed to be\n\n204\n00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,080\n bringing him him and the tribe back together again\n\n205\n00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,560\n after this terrible thing happened and they worshiped the golden calf then they had to execute each other\n\n206\n00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,720\n and then they are now trying to make them make everything right again now 70 leaders are dead\n\n207\n00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,640\n how is he going to explain this sayyid namusa became so\n\n208\n00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,720\n shocked that he uttered a statement and allah forgave him for it and never even judged him for it\n\n209\n00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:47,840\n he says okay if you have wished you had killed them before and killed me too well how am i going to live\n\n210\n00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,880\n with this how am i going to live with this you just killed them over there when they were\n\n211\n00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,160\n having uh stabbing each other and you might as well at this point kill me too\n\n212\n00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,520\n if you had willed you could have done this but why are we going through this hardship this was an immense\n\n213\n00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,040\n hardship we are here learning about a trials of prophethood this was one of the greatest tribulations\n\n214\n00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,480\n he is going to completely lose his people at this point going to come back and tell them\n\n215\n00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,440\n they died how did they die did they fall off a mountain did a mountain lion eat them did an enemy\n\n216\n00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,040\n come no they asked to see allah then they died so allah killed them they are already teetering on their\n\n217\n00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,880\n iman is very weak they already worshiped the golden calf after what\n\n218\n00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,920\n now these people are something else they had just crossed the red sea and when they crossed the red\n\n219\n00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:50,640\n sea that night sayyidna musa alayhi salam had told them all get gather your tribes and travel with your\n\n220\n00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,160\n tribes in 12 separate lanes why because it'll be more difficult for the fir'aun to catch you\n\n221\n00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,560\n if you're in 12 different companies 12 tribes when they arrived at the red sea\n\n222\n00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,240\n they weren't all together as many people imagine they were all separate\n\n223\n00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,040\n so that this red sea actually split 12 times there were 12 splits of the red sea\n\n224\n00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,280\n now while they're traveling through the red sea they turned back to moses\n\n225\n00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:29,840\n you can't imagine what they're about to say what they told musa alayhi salam made musa shake\n\n226\n00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,840\n from anger and say oh allah give me patience with these people he's they said who here knows what they said\n\n227\n00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:47,360\n oh man they said oh musa we can't see each other anymore because of the waves make allah put windows\n\n228\n00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,640\n say no she couldn't believe what he's seeing he's hearing he cannot believe what he's hearing\n\n229\n00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:02,880\n you're seeing the water split the red sea is splitting for you in a miracle that had never happened to any other\n\n230\n00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,240\n prophet and you are still complaining that you can't see each other when you're about to die\n\n231\n00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,800\n the pharaoh is about to catch you and kill you all musa shook from his anger he couldn't believe\n\n232\n00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,680\n what is just being uttered here this is his story with these people they're teetering on iman\n\n233\n00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:33,680\n that is when he said this line that allah put in the quran this whole tribulation so what did he do\n\n234\n00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:41,680\n he returned the whole matter back to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala the fitna the bad thing that we hate the\n\n235\n00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,960\n trial it is not as some people say god let it happen allah allowed it to happen or allah does the good\n\n236\n00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,320\n shaytan does the evil these are all false no allah created it and there is no one responsible for its\n\n237\n00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:07,920\n existence besides allah this situation that i'm in these 70 people died it's your fitna you created\n\n238\n00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,480\n this fitna you will guide people with it and you will misguide people with it namely he is saying how\n\n239\n00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,560\n i react to this situation right now i can be guided or misguided many people they get stuck with a\n\n240\n00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,120\n tribulation and tribulation is not just\n\n241\n00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:35,280\n external tribulations internal envy is a tribulation hatred of yourself is a tribulation temptation is a\n\n242\n00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:42,240\n tribulation desire is a tribulation someone luring you in your desire is a tribulation\n\n243\n00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:50,960\n that's more likely the tribulation of muslims of the rich countries than the poor countries like the\n\n244\n00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,000\n poor countries they're getting victimized the tribulation is on the outside\n\n245\n00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,480\n us our tribulation is on the inside temptation desire excess can't control myself\n\n246\n00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:18,560\n the first Satan muslims is giving us the guidance here on how to handle a tribulation rule number one\n\n247\n00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:27,280\n pillar the most essential pillar do not believe that this tribulation exists on its own autonomously\n\n248\n00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,960\n externally there is no one who put it there but allah\n\n249\n00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:40,080\n that is the number one belief the beginning of healing and the beginning of surpassing your tribulation\n\n250\n00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:55,680\n the more belief that you place in the autonomous existence and action of a tribulation the more it grows\n\n251\n00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,160\n and the further you get from solving it\n\n252\n00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,640\n so for us\n\n253\n00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,680\n so for us some people i'm sure alcohol is not really much of an issue for most muslims\n\n254\n00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,760\n but temptations and desire is\n\n255\n00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:20,880\n and the things that lure these desires and create these desires is and we do have one prophet\n\n256\n00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,480\n yusuf alayhis salam who's an example for this prophet yusuf who's an example for this prophet yusuf was lord\n\n257\n00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:38,720\n he he did she desired she desired she desired him he desired her\n\n258\n00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,800\n some people try to do a tafseer of it in a different way and they try to say\n\n259\n00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:53,520\n she desired him and he desired to kill her for desiring him where are you trying to make stuff up\n\n260\n00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,160\n prophet yusuf alayhis salam\n\n261\n00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,760\n it is nothing wrong in holding that a prophet desires women\n\n262\n00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840\n the concepts\n\n263\n00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,000\n the concept not desires zina desires women the general concept prophets eat food they desire food\n\n264\n00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,520\n right prophets get sick prophets get hit by their enemies prophet can get attacked by jinns\n\n265\n00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,440\n people get so shocked to know that the prophet suffered from black magic\n\n266\n00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,280\n what is black magic except jinns incessantly whispering in your ear\n\n267\n00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,440\n we believe prophets are attacked by humans why is it so surprising they get attacked by jin\n\n268\n00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:39,760\n a prophet was swallowed by a whale that's an animal right so there's nothing wrong with the concept\n\n269\n00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:47,120\n a prophet sees an attractive woman in front of him and his biology kicks in that's it his his his hormones\n\n270\n00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,640\n kick in just like any prophet sees any human being sees a nice cooked meal and his stomach and his desire\n\n271\n00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:02,560\n kicks in so there's nothing wrong in holding the correct tafsir which is that she desired him and he desired her\n\n272\n00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,120\n if it was just not if it was just not that he saw the proof of his lord and many people interpret that differently\n\n273\n00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,720\n we don't know exactly what is the proof of his lord some people say\n\n274\n00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,160\n in some of the tafsirs that his father is haq\n\n275\n00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:31,120\n sensed his son was in trouble and he shouted out yeah yusuf it's aqillah\n\n276\n00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,840\n and he heard it he heard it and once he heard the voice of his father everything changed\n\n277\n00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,520\n because he hasn't heard the voice of his father in so long so he ran out the door immediately his\n\n278\n00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,760\n he's just completely transformed inside of him your hormones change immediately like that\n\n279\n00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,280\n and he left so there's nothing wrong with the concept and understanding if a prophet suffered it we're\n\n280\n00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,640\n gonna suffer it and that's what most youth are suffering is temptation\n\n281\n00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:14,240\n some people are also suffering desperation can't get a job can't get married desperation right\n\n282\n00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,640\n these are all tribulations so the first pillar is to realize it is not an autonomous thing these sources\n\n283\n00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,920\n of temptation these people seeking wives and husbands that can't this is allah's test\n\n284\n00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,240\n and if you believe in the medium of the test the test always has to have a medium\n\n285\n00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,320\n so temptation cannot exist without a temptress someone to tempt you and all these companies\n\n286\n00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,520\n who are trying to tempt you to destroy themselves they know the psychology if youth if you raise a\n\n287\n00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:59,280\n generation of people who never control their sexual desires you can enslave them they're already slaves to\n\n288\n00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:06,240\n themselves they are already have a slave mentality they already have a mentality that i cannot stop\n\n289\n00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,800\n this from happening i cannot stop myself they have a slave mentality already they know deep inside\n\n290\n00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,160\n themselves they can't control themselves and once you have that generation they're slaves then the\n\n291\n00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,880\n nation can do whatever it wants to you and you will just accept it and that's why one of the hallmarks of\n\n292\n00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,880\n islam and muslims is to face the issue of temptations head-on and that issue begins by realizing all these\n\n293\n00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,400\n temptresses all these websites all these apps all these sources of the temptation they are nothing other\n\n294\n00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:49,920\n than a fitna allah has created on the earth not a company not a woman not a website allah is the source of it\n\n295\n00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,560\n you have to have that belief and people can sometimes they shake about the concept\n\n296\n00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,360\n what do you think anything exists besides the will of allah outside the will of allah\n\n297\n00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,400\n so what do i do then now that i have what what you have done is you have just stripped it of its power\n\n298\n00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,160\n and returned its power to allah that thing now has no power in your heart you've stripped it of its power\n\n299\n00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,800\n and you've given its power the power to allah you have no power over me\n\n300\n00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:30,480\n all right likewise the oppressor the enemies one of the tafasir of allah's hands is above their hands\n\n301\n00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,320\n one of the tafasirs of that just as the meaning of it not in the context is about the oppressor\n\n302\n00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:44,560\n is about the oppressor that oppressor don't give him power by believing that he autonomously exists and he is\n\n303\n00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,120\n oppressing you no you're not you are a tool of allah you are a tool of allah nothing less that allah's\n\n304\n00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:58,080\n hand is above their hands you are what you are doing is taking the power from them and returning\n\n305\n00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,960\n it to allah now this is a just a tool has no power in that case my business is not fighting this rabid\n\n306\n00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,760\n dog that keeps attacking me the dog has an owner talk to the owner don't fight the rabid dog talk to\n\n307\n00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,920\n the owner one of the greatest of shiukh he said people try to approach allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and\n\n308\n00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,520\n then a wild dog comes in their way why don't busy yourself with the dog the dog is nothing but a tool\n\n309\n00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,960\n busy yourself with the owner and say oh owner i'm trying to come into the house you invited me to\n\n310\n00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440\n the dog's in the way remove it\n\n311\n00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:43,120\n that's what you have to do when you hear have a fitna so wait a second now you want a favor from\n\n312\n00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:51,520\n the owner what's your relationship with the owner you want a favor from the owner now fix that relationship\n\n313\n00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,120\n and whatever you ask for will be given to you fix that relationship with allah this is the fiqh\n\n314\n00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,640\n of handling of how prophets handle trials\n\n315\n00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:15,680\n it is the core it is the core of how to handle the tribulation is to strip all the power from the\n\n316\n00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,680\n medium of the tribulation you know how many alcoholics they fear alcohol they literally have\n\n317\n00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:32,080\n given belief to alcohol and you give power to a bully the more you believe in that bully the more you\n\n318\n00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:39,600\n believe that that bully has control over you and you realize that the only way out is to realize he has no\n\n319\n00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:48,720\n power of his own and so now we start to come to the question of where how do we get our dua answered\n\n320\n00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,320\n if this is the matter okay how do we get our dua answered and the dua has a few preconditions\n\n321\n00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:07,920\n the first precondition is rectify your wealth why is it that food and wealth\n\n322\n00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,360\n and clothes is a prerequisition of dua it doesn't necessarily the food you eat and the dua you make\n\n323\n00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:24,320\n what is the connection here the connection is that the food you eat results from the wealth that you earn\n\n324\n00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:34,800\n the wealth you earn is what you do every single day all day right you wake up in the morning where's the\n\n325\n00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,240\n first place you head you had to work and you spend all day and the bulk of your energy\n\n326\n00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,440\n is spent at work and how many days you go to work every day five days a week\n\n327\n00:37:50,560 --> 00:38:01,120\n 50 weeks a year so you disobey all that time you are in constant non-stop disobedience of allah so\n\n328\n00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,440\n the morsel of food that is haram is a result of somebody who devotes his life to disobeying allah\n\n329\n00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,920\n that's why your earning is the precondition of your daughter how are you going to come and ask me a question\n\n330\n00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:23,600\n when you bother me every day all day you wake up plotting against my plans i have plans and you all\n\n331\n00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,920\n day work against my plans you have the nerve now to ask me a question no matter how desperate you look\n\n332\n00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:39,520\n the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said perhaps there is a man imagine there is a man now dusty and\n\n333\n00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:47,920\n disheveled okay rejected by people are you still feeling bad for him he has nobody but allah\n\n334\n00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,240\n he lifts his hands up in a summer not here\n\n335\n00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:02,400\n ibtihal du'a like said what we talked about this is called du'a and ibtihal this is a good du'a this\n\n336\n00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:13,040\n is absolute desperation okay hea coolu ya rab ya rab the prophet here has listed four reasons why your du'a\n\n337\n00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,920\n would be answered you're dusty and disheveled that means i'm a traveler i'm away i'm poor you're\n\n338\n00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,400\n look pitiful you look someone would have sympathy for you rejected from people's homes more sympathy\n\n339\n00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,800\n for you you're rejected you put your hands up that is one of the reasons allah accepts du'a\n\n340\n00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,200\n because you put your hands up and another reason that allah accepts your du'a is you call you say\n\n341\n00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,160\n ya rab ya rab and allah loves to hear his slaves say ya rab ya rab and still his du'a is not answered\n\n342\n00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,760\n why after all the reasons for du'a are there\n\n343\n00:39:49,760 --> 00:40:04,640\n prophet salam then said his clothes is haram he's nourished from haram his wealth is haram how\n\n344\n00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,760\n is he going to receive an answer when he says his wealth is haram his food is haram that doesn't mean\n\n345\n00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:18,000\n he accidentally ate pork it means his job the way he earns his money every day he wakes up disobeys\n\n346\n00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,840\n allah until the evening wakes up the next day disobeys allah until the evening so you have to\n\n347\n00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,960\n make sure your job is halal what is what is what is the meaning of your job is halal it means the\n\n348\n00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,160\n essence of the job is halal it doesn't mean that sometimes something haram comes up\n\n349\n00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:43,680\n the essence of the job to give an example i work at a grocer as an example working at a grocer is halal\n\n350\n00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:53,600\n one day out of a hundred the grocer says to me hey i need you to leave off forget the fruits and\n\n351\n00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:01,760\n vegetables i need you to go get that shipment of pork and put it on the shelves because your\n\n352\n00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,600\n colleague is is is not here today you need to do that job so that is a job essentially it's halal\n\n353\n00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:15,120\n i'm just working in fruits and vegetables that request is haram so you can keep that job but just\n\n354\n00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:21,760\n don't do what is haram you just don't do that portion of it okay that's the portion you don't do\n\n355\n00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,400\n in contrast a liquor store the entire essence of the business is haram the essence of the the the\n\n356\n00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:38,640\n this business this this transaction is haram you say hey you're an electrician right could you change\n\n357\n00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,880\n a light bulb for me here go up there and change this this big light bulb i don't want you to touch\n\n358\n00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,440\n the wine just change the light bulb you can't do that why you're contributing to something the essence of\n\n359\n00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,640\n it is forbidden so you have to understand that's the nature of choosing a job you don't choose a job\n\n360\n00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:04,880\n or not based on what may happen you choose on the essence of the job okay a nurse halal but the moment\n\n361\n00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:13,200\n they ask you to shut the door with another guy that moment you have to not you have to avoid that as much\n\n362\n00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,080\n as you can now what happens if i if i don't avoid it amen what happens if i don't avoid this\n\n363\n00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:29,200\n then you give some sadaqa make it so far make toba but you also have a brain you have a tongue you can\n\n364\n00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,720\n talk you go and tell the boss i can't continue to do this this was one time thing we up it happened i can't\n\n365\n00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,760\n do it again if you don't do that then you got a problem and he says no this is part of your job\n\n366\n00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:51,280\n description every tuesday you're on pork then you say okay now i can't do this job okay you go to the\n\n367\n00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:59,200\n nurses station i know i knew a guy who said he's training to be a masseuse massage therapy for like\n\n368\n00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,240\n people who are injured and things like that so he said like and where do you work he said i work\n\n369\n00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,920\n in um you know like one of these places that they give physical therapy i said so 19 year old girl\n\n370\n00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:20,880\n with a groin injury you're doing the job his dad started cracking up but how could you not ask this\n\n371\n00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,040\n question i'm a massage therapist for injured athletes there are no 70 year old athletes\n\n372\n00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:39,360\n every athlete is nice and physically fit okay every athlete is young okay who are you massaging okay\n\n373\n00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,920\n what body part is injured most athletics happens with legs and thighs and\n\n374\n00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,720\n calves what are you touching all day and all night like this you better make your job halal or else\n\n375\n00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,360\n your aunt your du'a is not going to be answered condition number two is you have to act\n\n376\n00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,520\n you must take action at tasabbub\n\n377\n00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:10,320\n understanding tasabbub is so important in getting over trials and getting du'a answered tasabbub does\n\n378\n00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,560\n you do not believe in the action but you do it out of obedience of allah that is the meaning\n\n379\n00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,040\n of tasabbub a sebbub is merely a means okay the means by which i could drink this tea is this mug\n\n380\n00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,680\n this mug is not responsible for nourishing me or getting me the tea just the means\n\n381\n00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:36,160\n there is no way to drink without a cup you have to have a cup but the cup has no role in presenting me\n\n382\n00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:46,480\n the tea or nourishing me so it's necessary to have but it is for forbidden to believe in anyone who believes oh how\n\n383\n00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,720\n did you you know get healthy how's your throat healthy because of the cup because the cup\n\n384\n00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,400\n no the cup didn't do anything the person who made the tea and then the nutrients in the tea and then\n\n385\n00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,680\n the arm that picked up the tea the cup has no role in any of this but it's necessary so that's what you have\n\n386\n00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:13,440\n to believe the asbab have no role whatsoever in transforming you in bringing in it in effect zero\n\n387\n00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:23,120\n but it's necessary just like a cup so the asbab may be i go to alcoholics anonymous the asbab may be\n\n388\n00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,360\n i don't go to that person's house anymore because all the trouble happens when i go to his house\n\n389\n00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:36,320\n the asbab may be i don't hang out at night with the computer in my room anymore because all the trouble\n\n390\n00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:45,840\n happens when that happens so the asbab may be that i cut those practices off okay you don't believe for a\n\n391\n00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:52,400\n second that that's going to be that's the source of your salvation you believe that allah will not\n\n392\n00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:01,200\n save me unless i take some action a reasonable intelligent action towards my goal so this is our\n\n393\n00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,440\n aqeeda towards asbab i'm telling you this is revolutionary our aqeeda towards this the tribulation itself\n\n394\n00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:18,560\n the precondition and then the aqeeda towards action you have to act and what is allah ta'ala does not\n\n395\n00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,600\n help a person until he starts helping themselves your body needs to be sweaty at the end you need\n\n396\n00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:30,400\n to put in effort okay but you need to not believe in your actions there's a big difference between\n\n397\n00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:38,400\n doing it and believing it so that's precondition number two precondition number three if you have any\n\n398\n00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:48,560\n doubts that your speech is not reaching the owner and you have any doubts that the owner is not going to\n\n399\n00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,160\n answer you then you yourself have buried your own prayer\n\n400\n00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:07,600\n i'm telling you all tribulation ends up being a journey between you and allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\n\n401\n00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:16,800\n usually through the form of dua you cannot have a single doubt that it will be answered but the timing is\n\n402\n00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,760\n is with allah that's the condition the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said\n\n403\n00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:33,200\n you will get your dua as long as you don't rush don't rush and don't say maybe it's going to be\n\n404\n00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,160\n answered in a different way maybe it's going to be saved to me the akhira don't say that just because\n\n405\n00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,040\n the prophet told you that that is a reality does not mean you're allowed to rely upon that and say\n\n406\n00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,520\n that and make an excuse i'm like dua is not going to be answered no you have no business with that\n\n407\n00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,440\n that other aspect if it happens it happens you have no business the default of dua\n\n408\n00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:00,080\n that's the default is that's the default of dua call upon me i answer you exactly what you ask me i answer you that's the default\n\n409\n00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,320\n the sahaba said\n\n410\n00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:25,520\n and what is this rushing what does it mean to rush he said you stop making dua and you say\n\n411\n00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,080\n that one of you says i i made dua but i didn't get an answer so what did you do you quit\n\n412\n00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,840\n you will get the answer as long as you keep asking and you don't quit\n\n413\n00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:45,360\n so that is the fourth precondition third we said no doubt fourth you don't stop\n\n414\n00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:52,400\n and you don't fall for these shaitanic tricks he said don't make a dua stop making the dua because\n\n415\n00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,200\n maybe allah has something different for your plans that's a shaitanic trick he's using truth\n\n416\n00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,920\n to undo a greater truth that's how shaitan works one of the tricks of iblis is to use the truth\n\n417\n00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:15,040\n to cancel a greater truth okay and he used the truth yes it could be that something else is prepared for you\n\n418\n00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,480\n but that is not what the prophet told you to do you have no business with that that is allah's work\n\n419\n00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:31,680\n your business is to make dua as allah told you have certainty and don't stop this these means these\n\n420\n00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:41,520\n methods are guaranteed this is not a whimsical god this is something very important like your parents\n\n421\n00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,480\n are human beings they're whimsical you catch them on a good mood they say yes you catch them on a bad day\n\n422\n00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,720\n they say no allah does not have good days and bad days it's a principle it's mathematical it's an\n\n423\n00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,600\n algorithm it always works there is no good moods bad moods there are some kids the kid is cute he\n\n424\n00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:09,680\n gets what he wants there's another kid he's not so cute the parent is not in a put in a good mood when\n\n425\n00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:17,680\n that kid comes you're human beings you cannot possibly tell me that you have that one cute\n\n426\n00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,200\n kid let's say a cute girl comes to you she have you have a little girl and that is like a porcelain doll\n\n427\n00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,320\n as soon as you see her you're in a bright mood okay he puts you in a good mood if allah subhanahu\n\n428\n00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:37,200\n ta'ala says in the quran describing the calf of the bani israel a goal a yellow-haired calf\n\n429\n00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:44,560\n that makes the onlooker happy if allah says that about an animal right that means there could be a\n\n430\n00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:53,200\n yellow-haired calf that all the hair is yellow and a dark-haired calf he's allah is telling you people\n\n431\n00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,320\n look at the yellow one they feel they're in a good mood that's why mcdonald's made yellow\n\n432\n00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:07,280\n to make the kids attracted to it okay so imagine humans a beautiful baby girl a pimply teenager\n\n433\n00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:16,160\n neither he is handsome now on top of that he's pimply okay and he the growth isn't even\n\n434\n00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:24,880\n sometimes summer the nose grew faster than the rest of the face this person does not inspire a good mood\n\n435\n00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,680\n you are a human being right so your parents you have to deal with that with humans\n\n436\n00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:35,520\n there was a woman she said she entered islam she was a convert and she put on hijab they said what's\n\n437\n00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,560\n the difference they said i have to work at relationships now i don't get favors anymore\n\n438\n00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:45,920\n no one gives me favors before this everyone give me favor i didn't have a fare for the bus\n\n439\n00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:53,600\n they let me on i sign up for a job i get the job right lookism it's called people see another person\n\n440\n00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,920\n who's attractive they're in a great mood yeah we want this person walking around the office what is\n\n441\n00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,520\n she going to do who the heck knows bring her in the office no one's going to say that about a hijabi\n\n442\n00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,080\n right now she puts on hijab she's got to work to get a job she gets rejected\n\n443\n00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,200\n now because that beauty factor is covered\n\n444\n00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,120\n but allah is not whimsical and he doesn't play favorites he doesn't care how you look he doesn't\n\n445\n00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,640\n care your ethnicity he doesn't have any of these things this is why people love allah there are no\n\n446\n00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,200\n favorites with allah in this respect hear how you look how cool you are what you are what you do none of\n\n447\n00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:38,320\n that matters it's a principle there are no good moods and there's no enough in fact it's the opposite\n\n448\n00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:45,360\n now you got that pretty girl comes to you and says can i go out with zayna her mom's taking us to ice cream\n\n449\n00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,680\n of course as long as you do your homework he tries to be fair and throw in a condition that's so\n\n450\n00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:00,160\n ridiculously simple as long as you give me a kiss like as long as if he's given her a condition\n\n451\n00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:08,160\n right that's so ridiculously simple so he can look fair right he gives her everything she's spoiled\n\n452\n00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,160\n okay even that dad who falls gets weak-kneed whenever he sees his daughter\n\n453\n00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:22,080\n even that dad himself the second request oh after zayna of the ice cream they want to have a sleepover\n\n454\n00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:29,680\n okay fine have the sleepover after the sleepover next day we want to go to great adventure\n\n455\n00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:38,800\n okay okay you're cute to a limit no enough learn to stop when you're ahead right\n\n456\n00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:47,440\n every human being will have a limit and allah has no limits so get that out of your head\n\n457\n00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,920\n my dua was answered i guess that's the dua that i get every decade right i can't this is never going\n\n458\n00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:00,000\n to happen again for another decade why are you assuming that you're treating allah like a human just like\n\n459\n00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,360\n parents let you go on that one trip once finally man you'd shut your mouth another five years right\n\n460\n00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,840\n you know the drill you know the drill you know that you're going to come home from the trip get to the\n\n461\n00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:23,040\n chores do some don't bring up anything at that point because you've used up your credits okay allah's not\n\n462\n00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,680\n like this and many people one time as we we were camping and we didn't have an alarm clock so a\n\n463\n00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:36,240\n brother taught us and he said recite ikhlas falak nas three times before you sleep then allah will send\n\n464\n00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:42,960\n an angel to wake you up at the time you need we did it and it worked the next day we also didn't have an\n\n465\n00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,200\n alarm clock but the brother said no no this time we're leaving the camp we gotta go and we said no well\n\n466\n00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,960\n we really it's far away we don't have to because it's far away it's not reasonable well we have\n\n467\n00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:01,360\n the falak ikhlas annas all right ikhlas falak annas he said i don't want to use up my credits\n\n468\n00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:08,320\n as if you only get one answer dua a day or something like one answer dua a week you're treating allah like\n\n469\n00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:14,880\n a whimsical parent who has limits that's the problem you can't do this in fact the prophet told us the\n\n470\n00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:23,360\n opposite okay man who doesn't ask allah then allah becomes angered with you why because you\n\n471\n00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,400\n believe he has limits now you believe he has limits if you don't ask allah he becomes angered with you\n\n472\n00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,920\n you believe he has limits you believe he's whimsical you believe he plays favorites you believe it's\n\n473\n00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:40,480\n exhausting him all of that is forbidden for us to believe about inconceivable for allah\n\n474\n00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,960\n and that's why people they they sort of make themselves hesitate they don't realize no you can\n\n475\n00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:54,320\n dua can be accepted in major ways every single day and that's why you have to it's an algorithm so now\n\n476\n00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:00,000\n you have to follow the timings you have to seek out the right times because there are times and places\n\n477\n00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,080\n that are sacred and there are states that are sacred what are the states that are sacred traveling and\n\n478\n00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:15,440\n sickness hajj sujood and oppression when you're oppressed when someone oppresses you to the point\n\n479\n00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:24,480\n that like you feel so down about what's happened hold on make dua he's gonna be answered because who\n\n480\n00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:31,200\n remembers allah at that moment all right he's gonna be answered so there are states and conditions that are\n\n481\n00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:38,000\n sacred there are places that are sacred masajid in general and the three great mosques in specific\n\n482\n00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,440\n okay\n\n483\n00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:49,040\n there are times that are sacred and that's what we have to jump on the last third of the night\n\n484\n00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,000\n if you don't take your affairs to the last third of the night you're not serious\n\n485\n00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,120\n you are not serious if you don't take your affairs in the last third of the night because\n\n486\n00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:03,600\n that's where things are given for free everything's given for free immediate if you don't take advantage\n\n487\n00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,160\n of the last third of the night when you need something you're not serious you don't deserve it\n\n488\n00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,600\n so you have to take advantage and that's why the people of allah love the winter\n\n489\n00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:23,600\n because the nights are so long and it's not difficult to get up before fajr whereas the\n\n490\n00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:31,760\n summer time sometime then the fajr may come 3 30. i slept aisha came in at 10 30. like by the time i slept it\n\n491\n00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:41,040\n was 11 30. it's hard to wake up at three but the winter is a time the feast and if you keep attacking\n\n492\n00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:48,400\n that last third of the night eventually you're gonna hit the right time people don't understand\n\n493\n00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:56,800\n what it means it actually means as imam madick said that when the door opens\n\n494\n00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,920\n for the time of hijab whatever comes out of your mouth is given to you\n\n495\n00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,120\n that's how simple it is oh is is it really reasonable that's not anything about this\n\n496\n00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,160\n what comes out of your mouth if you are awake making dua at that hour what comes out of your\n\n497\n00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,840\n mouth is given to you subhanallah this is why they prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said do\n\n498\n00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,440\n not make dua against people because even if that time the doors of the heavens are open\n\n499\n00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:33,920\n it will happen okay it will happen in egypt they always used to repeat on their tongues and i\n\n500\n00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:41,200\n don't know if they still do this may allah destroy your house right even just jokingly\n\n501\n00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:48,720\n if you whatever you utter jokingly or seriously if the gates of the heavens are open at that time\n\n502\n00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,960\n it's going to happen so when you have a population 80 million people and each every single person from\n\n503\n00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:02,960\n age 5 to age 100 utters this phrase probably 10 times a day it's just a phrase that's off their\n\n504\n00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,480\n mouth constantly constantly may allah destroy your house may allah destroy your house you do something\n\n505\n00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,400\n may allah destroy your house you're five minutes late may allah destroy your house we're waiting for you\n\n506\n00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:17,360\n hey this is your friend right okay constantly knots up someone pays for you you eat together someone\n\n507\n00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:26,400\n prays for you hellah destroy your house okay you're not taking dua seriously one of these times it's\n\n508\n00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,120\n guaranteed many many times the gates of heaven were open and someone said it and millions of people said it\n\n509\n00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:40,160\n that's why you go to egypt and it's destroyed is it upright you want to go live there\n\n510\n00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:48,800\n no you don't want to go there you don't have to be a tourist there okay you someone tells you hey\n\n511\n00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:54,160\n i'm taking a vacation to cairo you laugh you don't know what you're getting yourself into\n\n512\n00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:04,720\n so this is the power the this is essentially the power that we have we strip the power from our\n\n513\n01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:15,440\n tribulation by disbelieving in it and we ask our owner the owner of this dog to remove it take it away\n\n514\n01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:22,400\n so tribulation becomes the beginning it becomes a journey between yourself and allah subhanahu\n\n515\n01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:36,320\n and allah subhanahu wa ta'ala through rectifying our wealth and through dua\n\n",

		"transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,340\n In the last two months, the war in Gaza has really heightened the attention that Islam\n\n2\n00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,920\n is getting. And there are a lot of Muslims themselves who are now starting to answer\n\n3\n00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,980\n questions, learn their deen. And we here at Safina Society have produced a platform called\n\n4\n00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,700\n ARC view for this purpose exactly. Want to absorb and all those Muslims who are studying their\n\n5\n00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,640\n religion for the first time. And we want to make it super simple for them. One of the questions that\n\n6\n00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,900\n we have to answer that we often get is why we teach the Sharia or the sacred law through the\n\n7\n00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,280\n Medhebs, right? And there are four Medhebs and this set of videos, I want to share with you why exactly\n\n8\n00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,680\n they exist. What is a Medheb in the first place? And then why we study them and answer some questions\n\n9\n00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,960\n you may get and hear going around in Muslim circles about Medhebs. The first question is,\n\n10\n00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,900\n what is a Medheb?\n\n11\n00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:22,440\n Quite simply, a Medheb is a series of opinions or a method of doing something. A Medheb linguistically\n\n12\n00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:32,140\n is a way. And in the field of Sharia, studies of Islam, it's an educated methodology that will help\n\n13\n00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,820\n you get to the truth. And that's what the goal of everybody is. Now, why would we need that when we\n\n14\n00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,380\n have a very clear book? The Qatai, explicit foundations of the religion have no discussion\n\n15\n00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,300\n on them. They're crystal clear. No one is going to differ and say, well, my interpretation is that\n\n16\n00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,720\n Mecca is actually in Jerusalem, right? For Hajj. No one's going to say Ramadan is actually not the\n\n17\n00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,720\n month of Ramadan that we have now, but it's another month. So the foundations, no one should,\n\n18\n00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,720\n when people say the Sahaba did things differently, they worry. The foundations are set. These are the\n\n19\n00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,800\n explicit verses that cannot be differed upon. But on the inexplicit verses, where you need to think\n\n20\n00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,300\n and you need to show how something is done. Okay. So we all agree. We have to wash our face,\n\n21\n00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,500\n our arms, our feet, and wipe our hair and we'll do it. No one disagrees. But how, what is washing?\n\n22\n00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,880\n Do I just dunk it in is enough? So on that, there are medlems. Every field of discipline\n\n23\n00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,480\n has medlems. Insofar as something is up for discussion, you have schools of thought.\n\n24\n00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,480\n If I want to get from Jersey to New York, there are medlems. There are different ways to do it.\n\n25\n00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,260\n I can go by train. I can go by car. I could take the Holland Tunnel. I could take the Lincoln Tunnel.\n\n26\n00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,960\n I could take the GW. All right. I could go to Jersey City and take the PATH train. So that's\n\n27\n00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:00,080\n physically in life. What a strategy to achieve something. Okay. I could be defensive. I could be\n\n28\n00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,460\n offensive. All right. I could be conservative. I could go in attack mode. There are methodologies of\n\n29\n00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:13,560\n doing things in life. These are methods. So in Islam, because we have different verses that are not\n\n30\n00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,200\n explicit, the scholars have methods. Because we have discussion about hadith.\n\n31\n00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,240\n Which hadith are you going to prefer? The hadith of Aisha or Ibn Mas'ud on, for example, the issue of\n\n32\n00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,480\n eyebrows, right? Someone might say Ibn Mas'ud is more knowledgeable. So hold on. This is about issue\n\n33\n00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,480\n of women. You're going to take you from Aisha. Aisha is also, the Prophet said, take half your deen from\n\n34\n00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,200\n this little red hair. Okay. Do I take my part of the deen that's about war that she never attended?\n\n35\n00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,180\n Right? So she may be the most knowledgeable, but not in matters of warfare. She never attended\n\n36\n00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,240\n those. And a person who was with the Prophet 24 hours a day in the masjid was not with him at home.\n\n37\n00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,860\n Right? So on all these things you have, it's up for discussion. Anything that in which there's up\n\n38\n00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,060\n for discussion, there are methods. So a person shouldn't suddenly be scared. Although I thought\n\n39\n00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,840\n we had a very solid religion and was unified. Yes, it's unified in what's explicit, the foundations,\n\n40\n00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,540\n like a tree. Allah made a tree. The foundation is very strong. The trunk is extremely strong\n\n41\n00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:22,140\n and the branches are flexible. And that flexibility, Umar ibn Abdul Aziz said, the difference of opinion\n\n42\n00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:30,300\n in the ummah is a mercy. Because people's different circumstances require or can benefit from differences\n\n43\n00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,800\n as a little bit.\n\n",

		"transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600\n I'm a busy person or a mother with children who's working and taking care of kids.\n\n2\n00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:13,420\n Give me something very simple to latch on to that's easy, practical, that will be my rope along this path.\n\n3\n00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,920\n It's actually very easy. One.\n\n4\n00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,180\n Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim, alhamdulillah, wassalatu wassalamu ala rasulillah wa ala alihi wa sahbihi wa man wala.\n\n5\n00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,180\n Today I'm joined by Sheikh Ismail Bowers, who's a recent transfer here to the state of New Jersey.\n\n6\n00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,200\n We're lucky to have him here.\n\n7\n00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,880\n And also Sheikh Yahya Rodas, of course, needs no introduction from Allentown, Pennsylvania,\n\n8\n00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,120\n where you can go study at Al-Maqasid Seminary.\n\n9\n00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,340\n You could live there, study Arabic, study Uloom Shar'iyah.\n\n10\n00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,400\n And we continue with the subject of this Ramadan series, which is, is there a path to Allah?\n\n11\n00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,460\n What is the meaning of wilayah? These big questions.\n\n12\n00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,440\n What are the deeds that get us there?\n\n13\n00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,900\n What is the nature of this path?\n\n14\n00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,040\n So let me begin with that question with Sheikh Yahya.\n\n15\n00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,180\n What are the indicators from the Qur'an?\n\n16\n00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,100\n And what does it mean that there is a path to Allah?\n\n17\n00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,580\n Bismillah wa salatu wa salamu ala rasulillah wa ala alihi wa sahbihi wa man wa ala.\n\n18\n00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,000\n I think you can take this from the first chapter in the Qur'an, which is the Fatiha,\n\n19\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,700\n when Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says,\n\n20\n00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,120\n اهدين الصراط المستقيم, guide us to the straight path.\n\n21\n00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,060\n So in other words, is that there is explicitly, according to the Fatiha, a path.\n\n22\n00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,340\n And then the amazing thing is, right after this, Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala connects us to the people of the path.\n\n23\n00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,740\n So we have the meaning of the path itself, and then the people that tread that path.\n\n24\n00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,300\n يَرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْ أَمْتَعَ عَلِهِمْ\n\n25\n00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,100\n The path of those that you have bestowed your favor upon, further clarified in another verse,\n\n26\n00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,440\n that they are the prophets, the Siddiqeen, the martyrs, and the righteous.\n\n27\n00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,020\n And so that this is a path that exists.\n\n28\n00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,660\n We learn this from the prophets, and then there are people that have tread this path and have become successful in it.\n\n29\n00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,520\n And so I think that this is very clear, and there's multiple other verses that indicate this,\n\n30\n00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,680\n but this is a starting point.\n\n31\n00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:24,880\n Shaykh Ismail, you noticed Sharia here mentioned, not only is it a path, but it points to the people of the path.\n\n32\n00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,540\n Rather than saying the path of, could have said path of Islam, could have said the path of the Qur'an.\n\n33\n00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,000\n So what's the wisdom that it mentions the people of those paths?\n\n34\n00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,540\n بسم الله والحمد لله وصلى الله على سيدنا رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه ومن ولا.\n\n35\n00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,580\n Yeah, our scholars, they say, العلم في الصدور لا في الصطور.\n\n36\n00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,620\n That knowledge is taken from the breasts, from the hearts of men, not just from books.\n\n37\n00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,400\n And Allah عز و جل says in the Qur'an al-Kareem,\n\n38\n00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,520\n إِنَّ أَوْلِيَاءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n\n39\n00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,760\n One of my friends recently told me, subhanAllah, this is a sign that the awliya are always present.\n\n40\n00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,440\n They don't have fear, and they don't express, they don't experience sadness.\n\n41\n00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,060\n They're always with Allah عز و جل.\n\n42\n00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,600\n And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, he said,\n\n43\n00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,240\n أَوْلِيَاءَ اللَّهِ إِذَا رُؤُوا ذُكِرَ اللَّهِ\n\n44\n00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960\n That this is the sign of a wali.\n\n45\n00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,340\n If you see someone, when you see them, you remember Allah عز و جل.\n\n46\n00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,880\n This could be a sign that this person is from the awliya.\n\n47\n00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:35,340\n Very good. Now, next question that's come to us is, all of this subject matter seems very directed to the individual.\n\n48\n00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,900\n So is there a harm then, in that case, that a person will become passive, removed from society, only focused on himself?\n\n49\n00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:51,900\n Or is it that this is a precondition or a prerequisite to doing any of the work that society needs and the ummah needs?\n\n50\n00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,820\n So that, I think that you could answer that by saying the verse that Sheikh Ismail quoted there.\n\n51\n00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,780\n If you continue, it says that Allah Ta'ala describes who they are.\n\n52\n00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,200\n لَا خُوفَنَ عَلَمُ لَهُمْ يَحْزُونَ أَلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَكَانُوا يَتَّقُونَ\n\n53\n00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,660\n They are the people who believe and are people of taqwa, are mindful of Allah.\n\n54\n00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:19,460\n And if you look at what taqwa is, it's to fulfill the commandments of Allah inwardly and outwardly and to avoid His prohibitions inwardly and outwardly.\n\n55\n00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,400\n And there is a little bit of nuance to this topic, of course.\n\n56\n00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:30,120\n But if you look at throughout the Qur'an, all of the guidance of the Qur'an, there definitely is a societal dimension.\n\n57\n00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:41,320\n Yes, the nuance is in that there might be certain times and certain situations that there are certain ahadith that indicate that you should focus on yourself and not be as involved in certain situations.\n\n58\n00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,460\n But short of that, the awliya of Allah are usually the most active in society.\n\n59\n00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:55,600\n And they have such an impact on society precisely because they are so detached and they do everything through their Lord, subhanahu wa ta'ala.\n\n60\n00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,980\n There is a spiritual path.\n\n61\n00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,880\n There is also an enemy who is also very spiritual.\n\n62\n00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,360\n Iblis, in a sense, is spiritual.\n\n63\n00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,700\n He is someone that we don't see.\n\n64\n00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,960\n The jinn are a force that is unseen to us and seems to be of the spirit realm.\n\n65\n00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,300\n So, as there is an angelic realm to spirituality, there is also a dark realm.\n\n66\n00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,200\n How does a person navigate between the two?\n\n67\n00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,900\n I think by being with teachers and connecting yourself with people who are connected to people,\n\n68\n00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,540\n who are connected to people back to the Prophet ﷺ,\n\n69\n00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,320\n you really need, you know, some type of murabbi, some type of teacher, some type of mentor.\n\n70\n00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,020\n And there is a famous saying that, they say in many different cultures,\n\n71\n00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,160\n that the person who doesn't have a shaykh, shaytan is his shaykh, you know.\n\n72\n00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,100\n And so, you want to be connected to teachers who have sanad.\n\n73\n00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,060\n Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak, he says famously,\n\n74\n00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,640\n as-sanadu min ad-deen, law-las-sanad, la-qaala man-sha'a ma-sha'a.\n\n75\n00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,380\n That a chain of narration, sanad, is from our religion.\n\n76\n00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,440\n If it wasn't for that, and if we didn't have that, anyone could say anything.\n\n77\n00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,580\n And this is where you get people who are influenced by the shaytan,\n\n78\n00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,080\n influenced by their nafs, and they begin to spew, you know, information that has no basis.\n\n79\n00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,640\n So, what we do is we connect ourselves to Ahlullah, right?\n\n80\n00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,700\n The Prophet ﷺ says,\n\n81\n00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,560\n Ahlul Qur'an hum Ahlullah.\n\n82\n00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560\n That the people of the Qur'an are the people of Allah.\n\n83\n00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:34,160\n The people who have studied and sat with those who sat with those who sat with people that connect back to the Prophet ﷺ.\n\n84\n00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,580\n And this is a way to protect yourself.\n\n85\n00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,340\n This is a way to be a part of a community.\n\n86\n00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:46,860\n And especially, you know, we're encouraged to go to the masjid for the different prayers and for jumu'ah.\n\n87\n00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,000\n And there's a reason for that, to be with the community and with teachers and with brothers and sisters.\n\n88\n00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680\n Masha'Allah.\n\n89\n00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,600\n Let me just add something to that, because I think that you brought something up very important there, Dr. Shadi,\n\n90\n00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,560\n in that when you said that there's a spiritual dimension to shaytan, meaning that he's in the unseen.\n\n91\n00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,200\n These are things that we don't witness, and one of our teachers said recently, which I thought was very profound.\n\n92\n00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:20,480\n Because of the materialistic world in which we live, people are searching deep within their being for something from the immaterial realm,\n\n93\n00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,880\n because we are made of spirit and clay.\n\n94\n00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,960\n But if you don't have a teacher, as Shikha Ismail mentioned, you're not protected from sifting through what happens in the unseen.\n\n95\n00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,920\n So people could misinterpret, because of how focused they are on, and how materialistic their perspective is,\n\n96\n00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,140\n thinking that everything that happens to them from the realm of the unseen is something that is good.\n\n97\n00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,200\n And this is certainly the case with much of the pseudo-spirituality that is out there,\n\n98\n00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:53,820\n is that you open up the floodgates if you don't have the protection of this synod, of this chain, of these correct teachings, of this correct approach.\n\n99\n00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,200\n Meaning that you could have what you think is a spiritual experience, but it's actually demonic.\n\n100\n00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,020\n And this is the importance of really having the correct path in this whole thing.\n\n101\n00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,700\n So I think that's a very important point to know.\n\n102\n00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,260\n That's critical.\n\n103\n00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,360\n And I was once talking to a very educated Hindu person, and I was saying,\n\n104\n00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,660\n explain to me how is it these people get so educated, yet they still go to the temple.\n\n105\n00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:24,580\n And he basically said, the gurus, they are spiritually in touch.\n\n106\n00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,080\n And for a while, I thought, this can't be.\n\n107\n00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,680\n But then afterwards realized, yeah, they are in touch.\n\n108\n00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,820\n They are in touch with shayaltine.\n\n109\n00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,320\n They're in touch with shayaltine al-jinn.\n\n110\n00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,900\n Not every spiritual experience is a good experience.\n\n111\n00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,880\n A spiritual experience has to be of the right kind, from the right source.\n\n112\n00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,080\n So yeah, they are getting spirituality, but it's a dark spirituality.\n\n113\n00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,920\n And now let's ask this question.\n\n114\n00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,400\n I'm a simple person.\n\n115\n00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,300\n I'm watching this Ramadan series, fasting and working like every other person out there.\n\n116\n00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:03,140\n What is the number one fastest route on this path that we're calling there,\n\n117\n00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,440\n or that we're talking about in this series, the path of wilayah?\n\n118\n00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760\n Wilayah being divine protection, nearness to Allah.\n\n119\n00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,620\n This is the goal of every Muslim.\n\n120\n00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,780\n So I'm a working man.\n\n121\n00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,360\n I'm a busy person, or a mother with children who's working and taking care of kids.\n\n122\n00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,600\n Give me something very simple to latch on to, that's easy, practical,\n\n123\n00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,200\n that will be my rope along this path.\n\n124\n00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,740\n I would say it's actually very easy.\n\n125\n00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,900\n One, intention.\n\n126\n00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,560\n Reframe your whole life so that everything that you do is for the sake of Allah.\n\n127\n00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,860\n And have an intention behind everything that you do.\n\n128\n00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,120\n Two, in addition to the basics of the things you know you have to do, the five daily prayers, the fasting,\n\n129\n00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,620\n in addition to the basics, cultivate in your heart a love of the remembrance of Allah.\n\n130\n00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,480\n And then three, love.\n\n131\n00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:06,200\n If you can combine intention with extra devotional remembrance of Allah, and then love of Allah, and the love for the sake of Allah,\n\n132\n00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,580\n the doors will certainly open up in a very short period of time, inshaAllah.\n\n133\n00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,460\n Shaykh Ismail, you mentioned,\n\n134\n00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,960\n Allah described his path by people.\n\n135\n00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,400\n A lot of people out there, especially in the middle of America,\n\n136\n00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,020\n where maybe Shi'ukh don't live, or maybe parts of England, or wherever our viewers are,\n\n137\n00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,520\n don't have Shi'ukh.\n\n138\n00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,740\n They don't have access to Shi'ukh.\n\n139\n00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,920\n What's a replacement?\n\n140\n00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,820\n How do people make up for that?\n\n141\n00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,340\n Well, I was actually in that situation.\n\n142\n00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,220\n You know, when I was in college, I was in Johnson City, Tennessee.\n\n143\n00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,160\n And there was a masjid, but there was no imam, there was no shaykh, there was no teacher.\n\n144\n00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:55,160\n So, what I did was I tried to connect with Shi'ukh and teachers that were visiting in the surrounding areas,\n\n145\n00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960\n or to take some time to attend programs.\n\n146\n00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,500\n You know, and one of those teachers, Shaykh Yahya, mashallah, he came and he visited my hometown.\n\n147\n00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,460\n So, I went home for the summer, and I attended.\n\n148\n00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:12,580\n And so, you have Shi'ukh, and you have teachers who have an authentic sanat, right?\n\n149\n00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,140\n And they have real training in the sharia around you.\n\n150\n00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,560\n Actually, if you think about it, and you look up, you know, all of the opportunities and resources now here in the U.S.,\n\n151\n00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,220\n whether they're in masajid, or institutes that have developed recently, there are a lot of opportunities.\n\n152\n00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,420\n You just have to make the intention, and you just have to sacrifice a little bit of time.\n\n153\n00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:43,940\n And, you know, as Shaykh Yahya mentioned, if you have a good intention, Allah Azza wa Jal will facilitate.\n\n154\n00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,480\n And Allah will send people, and Allah will facilitate programs.\n\n155\n00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,740\n It's really just between you and Allah, and Allah knows your heart.\n\n156\n00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,260\n And so, people take time to go on vacation, right?\n\n157\n00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,080\n People take time off to do many different things.\n\n158\n00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,140\n If you take time off and sacrifice for the sake of your deen, a relationship with Allah Azza wa Jal,\n\n159\n00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,040\n like Allah says in Al-Quran Al-Kareem,\n\n160\n00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,560\n وَالَّذِينَ جَاهَدُوا فِينا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا\n\n161\n00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,840\n Those who struggle in our way, Allah will guide them.\n\n162\n00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,980\n So, it begins within.\n\n163\n00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:25,060\n If Allah sees that pure intention, He'll facilitate, but just keep going, you know.\n\n164\n00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,640\n All right, our last question for the segment.\n\n165\n00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,760\n If this is a path, there's progress and there's regress.\n\n166\n00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,860\n What are the signs of progress?\n\n167\n00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,700\n That's a question I'd like to ask both of you.\n\n168\n00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,720\n There are many signs, I think.\n\n169\n00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,380\n Succinctly, one of the signs is that you find istiqamah, which is uprightness, is facilitated for you.\n\n170\n00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,460\n And there could be short-term signs, like your heart expands, you start to taste the sweetness of worship.\n\n171\n00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,360\n But then that might be taken from you, and people oftentimes misinterpret what that means.\n\n172\n00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,700\n And they think that somehow they've been derailed, something happened to them,\n\n173\n00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:14,380\n and they're chasing this kind of early experience that they received when they first started setting out on the path to Allah Sopranathana.\n\n174\n00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:21,060\n So, I would say that the greatest sign really is a life of uprightness is facilitated for you.\n\n175\n00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,240\n And one of the things we have to recognize with the spiritual path, it's not linear.\n\n176\n00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,700\n It's not like reading a book from page 1 to page 150.\n\n177\n00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,040\n The spiritual path is not linear.\n\n178\n00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,840\n It's linear inwardly, but not outwardly.\n\n179\n00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,300\n There will be all types of things that come your way.\n\n180\n00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,700\n Our job is to respond to them with our servitude to Allah Sopranathana.\n\n181\n00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,200\n And you will get what you need in reality, but it's not going to necessarily be in the way that you think it's going to be,\n\n182\n00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,540\n or how you feel internally when things are happening.\n\n183\n00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:59,060\n Meaning, you might go through a major tribulation, and that's what you needed to reach the highest degrees, closest to Allah Sopranathana.\n\n184\n00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:05,440\n And the last thing I'll say is, is that spiritual growth also, like learning a language or anything else,\n\n185\n00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,500\n you will have your points where you plateau.\n\n186\n00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,680\n So, you kind of notice that you're increasing, but then it flattens out.\n\n187\n00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,560\n And then, the key is that when it flattens out, and you don't think that you're changing,\n\n188\n00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,800\n you keep exerting that spiritual struggle that Sheikh Ismail just referred to from that verse.\n\n189\n00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,320\n And then, what you'll find is, then you'll just like seem to like jump up.\n\n190\n00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,720\n So, like from like 30 to all of a sudden like 70% in that period of time.\n\n191\n00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,280\n But it requires that you keep putting that energy in to have that second increase after that ascension.\n\n192\n00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,780\n MashaAllah, yes.\n\n193\n00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:50,180\n And I'll add, you know, a sign of you progressing on that path is that you follow the sunnah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam\n\n194\n00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,300\n more and more in the right way, in the true way.\n\n195\n00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,120\n Meaning, if you become more religious, more spiritual, let's say, more obedient to Allah Azawajal,\n\n196\n00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,720\n but you're more judgmental, but you're not smiling as much anymore,\n\n197\n00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,600\n but you're breaking people's hearts, you know, through your tongue, through your actions,\n\n198\n00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,100\n and you're not becoming more merciful, you're not becoming tougher with yourself, but easier with others,\n\n199\n00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100\n then that's a major red flag.\n\n200\n00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:31,380\n And you find, all of us know, when we sat with our teachers, the very first hadith we study and we hear,\n\n201\n00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:39,660\n is, like the first hadith we study with our teachers of hadith is that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said,\n\n202\n00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,620\n those who are merciful with others will be shown mercy by the most merciful.\n\n203\n00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:51,840\n So if you become more religious, but you're less merciful, more judgmental, you know, always walking around with a frown,\n\n204\n00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,500\n then you're not truly following the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.\n\n205\n00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:02,060\n That's why it's so important to connect yourself with real teachers, and to also study the Seerah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,\n\n206\n00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,700\n because how will you know if you're on the right path or not?\n\n207\n00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,740\n You know, how will you know if you're following the right person or not?\n\n208\n00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,100\n Or you're just following the ego or what you think religiosity is?\n\n209\n00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,280\n Masha'Allah.\n\n210\n00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,100\n JazakumAllahu khairan.\n\n211\n00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,460\n Subhanakallahumma bihamdik.\n\n212\n00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,660\n Nashhadu an la ilaha illa anta.\n\n213\n00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,320\n Nastaaghfiruk wa natubu alayk.\n\n214\n00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,420\n And we'll see you tomorrow.\n\n215\n00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,840\n Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.\n\n216\n00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,280\n If you like these videos, you can
